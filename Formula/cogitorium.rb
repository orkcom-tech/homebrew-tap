  # Contextverse is a real dependency, declared rather than described.
  # Context and memory are stored and versioned by contextd; without it the
  # server starts and says so, and memory does not work. Homebrew can express
  # that, so it does — requirement 15 is "installs together with Contextverse",
  # and on this channel that means the package manager brings it.

    <<~EOS
      Start it with:
        cogitorium serve

      Then open http://127.0.0.1:8688. On a loopback address you are the admin
      and there is no login screen; the same binary asks for credentials the
      moment it listens on anything else.

      Gears and the terminal need Docker to be isolated. Without it, gears run
      with this server's own file access and the terminal refuses to open —
      the server says which at startup.
